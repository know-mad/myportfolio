              When all the pages are already available on a CDN close to the

          <p>
            For local B2C businesses, thousands of consumers a day in a 10 mile
            radius of your business are typing in "
            <span style={{ color: "#F446EC" }}>(insert desired service)</span>{" "}
            near me". And people are also just as much searching for solutions
            from B2B companies. Guess what? The companies with websites compete
            to be near the top result. And the companies without a website
            arenâ€™t even in the game. They have a 0% chance to bring in any of
            these active online customers.

            <br />
            While also having the ability to pair Google ads or Facebook ads
            with your website to jump to the top of these searches and promote
            your services at a very cheap rate of a few dollars per click. With
            no website, you canâ€™t use the best modern advertising methodsâ€”Google
            and Facebook adsâ€”to your advantage. If you get in the game of
            attracting new customers by having a website built, marketing your
            business will take a giant leap forward.

            <p>
              In its simplest form, headless commerce offers brands freedom of
              expression to build whatever and however they want. Most
              importantly, it enables brands to enrich the customer experience
              <br />
              <br />
              Businesses should consider headless commerce as an evolutionary
              shift in traditional e-commerce. While original e-commerce
              platforms offered front-end tools that enabled fast deployments
              for companies that had little internet selling experience, many
              businesses now employ highly trained software developers that want
              to remove the front-end training wheels.

            As consumer behaviour continues to evolve, businesses need to adapt
            their strategy to be where their customers are. As a result,
            companies are moving rapidly toward making mobile apps commonplace

              â€˜how can I give my brand a competitive edge?â€™

            . The answer... mobile apps! Industry leading companies are
            designing holistic experiences that leverage the personal nature of
            mobile.
            <br />
            <br />A mobile-first approach is imperative for successful
            businesses, yet many still are behind in adopting a mobile app
            strategy. Where mobile web can help raise awareness and increase
            traffic, mobile apps, on the other hand, allow you to foster the
            customer relationship and increase retention. Without a mobile
            presence, significant marketing opportunities are missed.
